First of all you need to create a configuration file in conf called test.yaml.
In order to do that you can copy the conf/test.yaml.example

If you want to use the obs you need to change the credentials (username/password)
 to yours in the build service at the conf/test.yaml

After you have a conf/test.yaml file, you can run it by:
cd lib
./gems-status.rb

have fun

TODO: write something else here :) !
