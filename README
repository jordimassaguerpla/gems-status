gem-status compares rubygems information from different sources as for reporting which gems are outdated.

Source can be:

- OpenSUSE BuildService
- Rubygems.org
- Gemfile.lock file

Data compared is:

- version
- md5sum

gem-status will output a report for each gem that is in all the sources, comparing versions and md5sums.

== INSTRUCTIONS

First of all you need to create a configuration file where you specify your sources.
In order to do that you can copy the conf/test.yaml.example and use it as a template.

If you want to use the obs you need to change the credentials (username/password)
 to yours in the build service at the configuration file.

After you have a configuration file, you can run it by:

bin/gems-status.rb conf_file

have fun!
